# ANALYZING THE BEST STOCK RETURN OPTIONS
Kimberly Ellerbe

The purpose of this project was too find the manipulate stock data in order to find the best return among differing 12 stock options based on return and volume.
The approach to the analysis was to write a VBA script that would look at the data over a 2 year time period and have it read through the table of data.  It would report back the stock volume and percentage returned earned on the stock over a year period for 2 years.

The script I tried to write and execute turned into an epic fail.  Using the refactored code, I was not able to make it work after several tries. In My .vbs file for AllStockAnalysis Refactored there is Module 2 and Module 3 at code attempts that did not work.  Therefore, I have no output for this project.

The entire project was a disadvantage in using refactored code.  I understood the objective, but the application was a bust.
